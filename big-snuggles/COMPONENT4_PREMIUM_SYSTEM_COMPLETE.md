## Stripe Integration (Ready for Keys)

### Required Configuration

**Backend (.env)**:
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...          # Your Stripe secret key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...     # For Stripe.js on frontend
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...        # For webhook verification
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173     # Already configured
```

**Frontend (.env)**:
```env
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...  # Your Stripe publishable key
```

### Setup Steps

1. **Get Stripe API Keys**:
   - Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
   - Copy "Publishable key" (pk_test_...)
   - Copy "Secret key" (sk_test_...)

2. **Add Keys to Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   echo "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_..." >> backend/.env
   echo "STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_..." >> backend/.env
   
   # Frontend
   echo "VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_..." >> frontend/.env
   ```

3. **Restart Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm start
   ```

4. **Configure Webhook** (after deployment):
   - Deploy backend to production
   - Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
   - Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/subscription/webhook/stripe`
   - Select events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`
   - Copy webhook secret and add to backend .env

### Checkout Flow

1. User clicks "Upgrade to Premium" on pricing page
2. Frontend calls `/api/subscription/checkout` with userId and tier
3. Backend creates Stripe Checkout Session
4. User redirected to Stripe-hosted payment page
5. After payment, redirected to `/subscription/success?session_id=...`
6. Webhook processes payment and activates subscription
7. User sees success page with tier features

### Test Cards

Use these cards in Stripe test mode:
- **Success**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Declined**: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- **Insufficient funds**: 4000 0000 0000 9995
- Any future expiry date, any CVC

---

## Testing Guide

### 1. Test Pricing Page
```bash
# Start frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Navigate to http://localhost:5173/pricing
# Verify:
- 3 pricing cards displayed (Free, Premium, Pro)
- Monthly/Yearly toggle works
- Feature lists are complete
- Trial badge on Premium tier
- Savings calculation for yearly
```

### 2. Test Feature Gates (without Stripe)
```bash
# Create test user in Supabase
# Set tier to 'free' in subscriptions table

# Try to create room (should be blocked)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/rooms/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "test-user-id", "name": "Test Room"}'

# Expected: 403 error with upgrade message

# Manually update tier to 'premium'
# Try again (should succeed)
```

### 3. Test Usage Tracking
```bash
# Generate clips until quota exceeded
# Should see quota warning at 80%
# Should be blocked at 100%
```

### 4. Test Subscription Flow (with Stripe keys)
```bash
# 1. Sign up as new user
# 2. Go to pricing page
# 3. Click "Start 7-Day Trial" on Premium
# 4. Fill in Stripe checkout with test card
# 5. Verify redirect to success page
# 6. Check database - subscription should be 'active'
# 7. Test premium features (should work now)
```

### 5. Test Quota Reset
```sql
-- Manually trigger monthly reset
SELECT reset_monthly_quotas();

-- Verify all quotas reset to 0
SELECT * FROM usage_quotas WHERE user_id = 'test-user-id';
```
