## 2. Phase 8 Component Overview

### Component 1: Multi-User Space Rooms Infrastructure

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Lines of Code:** ~2,900

The Multi-User Space Rooms component lays the foundation for all social interaction within Big Snuggles. It provides a robust, real-time infrastructure for users to create, join, and interact in shared conversational spaces.

#### Key Features Delivered:
*   **Room Creation & Management:** Users with premium tiers can create private rooms with unique, shareable 6-character codes. Room hosts have administrative privileges, including the ability to update room settings and delete rooms.
*   **Real-time Communication:** The system is built on Socket.IO, enabling low-latency broadcasting of messages, presence information, and state changes to all participants in a room.
*   **Presence Tracking:** A heartbeat system tracks online status, ensuring the participant list is always up-to-date. The system gracefully handles user disconnects and updates the room state accordingly.
*   **Database & Persistence:** A comprehensive database schema was implemented in Supabase, featuring tables for `rooms`, `room_participants`, and `room_messages`. Row Level Security (RLS) is enforced to ensure data privacy and security.
*   **Scalability & Cleanup:** The architecture is designed for scalability, with automated cleanup jobs to archive inactive rooms, ensuring optimal performance.

#### Technical Implementation:
*   **Backend:** A `RoomManager` service encapsulates all business logic, while a dedicated set of REST API endpoints (`/api/rooms`) and Socket.IO event handlers (`room:*`) manage room operations.
*   **Frontend:** The frontend features a dedicated "Spaces" lobby (`/spaces`), a dynamic `RoomPage` for active sessions, and a suite of React components for displaying participants (`ParticipantsList`) and managing room actions (`RoomControls`). A `RoomSocketContext` provides a clean, reusable interface for interacting with the real-time backend.

### Component 2: Audience Participation & Voting System

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Lines of Code:** ~2,000

This component enhances the multi-user experience by introducing an interactive voting system. It allows room hosts to engage their audience by creating polls, and it automatically applies the winning personality mode to the AI.

#### Key Features Delivered:
*   **Real-time Polls:** Hosts can create four types of polls: Topic Voting, Personality Mode, Audience Questions, and Quick Reactions.
*   **Live Results:** Participants see poll results update in real-time as votes are cast. The UI includes dynamic progress bars and percentage displays.
*   **Auto-Apply Personality Mode:** For "Personality Mode" polls, the system automatically identifies the winning option (e.g., "Gangster," "Wise Mentor") and updates the room's AI personality in real-time upon the poll's conclusion.
*   **One-Vote-Per-User:** The system is architected to ensure voting integrity, with database constraints and backend logic preventing duplicate votes.
*   **Host Controls & Automation:** Hosts can manually close polls, while a background worker automatically expires polls that have reached their time limit.

#### Technical Implementation:
*   **Backend:** The `VotingManager` service handles all poll logic, from creation to tabulation. REST endpoints (`/api/polls`) and Socket.IO events (`poll:*`) provide interfaces for the frontend. A materialized view in the database (`poll_results`) ensures efficient querying of results.
*   **Frontend:** New React components, including `PollCreationModal`, `ActivePollCard`, and `PollHistory`, provide a seamless user experience for creating, voting on, and viewing polls.

### Component 3: Clip Generator with FFmpeg

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Lines of Code:** ~3,100

The Clip Generator is a powerful content creation tool that allows users to generate and share highlight clips from their conversations. It leverages the robust FFmpeg library for high-quality media processing.

#### Key Features Delivered:
*   **Automated Highlight Detection:** An intelligent algorithm analyzes conversation transcripts for sentiment, keywords (humor, surprise, excitement), and engagement to automatically suggest highlight-worthy moments.
*   **Manual Clip Creation:** A timeline-based interface with a waveform visualization allows users to precisely select their desired start and end points for a clip.
*   **FFmpeg Processing:** All video and audio processing is handled by FFmpeg, ensuring professional-grade output. This includes audio extraction, video generation with waveform visualization, and thumbnail creation.
*   **Multi-Format Export:** Clips can be exported in multiple formats optimized for web delivery, including MP4, WebM, and MP3.
*   **Social Sharing:** A dedicated share modal allows for one-click sharing to popular platforms like Twitter and Facebook, with platform-specific recommendations.
*   **Background Processing:** FFmpeg jobs are managed in an asynchronous background queue, allowing users to continue using the application while their clips are being generated. Real-time progress is displayed on the frontend.

#### Technical Implementation:
*   **Backend:** The `ClipGenerator` service wraps all FFmpeg commands. A set of REST endpoints (`/api/clips`) handles clip creation, status tracking, and downloading. A background job queue manages resource-intensive FFmpeg processes.
*   **Frontend:** The `/clips` page provides a central hub for managing clips. The `ClipTimeline` component offers a rich, interactive experience for manual clip creation, while the `ClipCard` component displays clip status, metadata, and actions.
*   **Storage:** Generated clips and thumbnails are securely stored in a dedicated Supabase Storage bucket.

### Component 4: Premium Tier System with Stripe Integration

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Lines of Code:** ~1,100 (excluding DB migration)

This component introduces the monetization layer, a critical step for the long-term sustainability of Big Snuggles. It features a three-tier subscription model (Free, Premium, Pro) powered by Stripe.

#### Key Features Delivered:
*   **Three-Tier Subscription Model:** A flexible system offering different levels of features and quotas for each tier.
*   **Stripe Integration:** Secure payment processing is handled by Stripe, including checkout sessions, subscription management, and webhooks.
*   **Feature Gating & Quota Enforcement:** A robust middleware system (`featureGates.js`) protects premium features and enforces usage quotas (e.g., number of clips, rooms created) based on the user's subscription tier.
*   **Customer Portal:** Users can manage their subscription, update payment methods, and view invoices through a Stripe-hosted customer portal.
*   **Automated Lifecycle Management:** Stripe webhooks are used to automate the entire subscription lifecycle, including activations, cancellations, and failed payments.

#### Technical Implementation:
*   **Backend:** The `SubscriptionManager` service handles all business logic related to tiers, quotas, and Stripe interactions. REST endpoints (`/api/subscription`) manage checkout, the customer portal, and webhook handling.
*   **Frontend:** A responsive `PricingPage` displays the tier comparison. The `/subscription` dashboard allows users to view their current plan and usage. The `PremiumGate` component provides a simple way to lock down features in the UI.
*   **Database:** New tables (`subscriptions`, `payment_history`, `usage_quotas`, `tier_features`) were added to manage subscription data, with full RLS policies for security.

## 4. Architecture and Integration

Phase 8 was designed as a cohesive ecosystem where each component seamlessly integrates with the others.

*   The **Multi-User Rooms** component serves as the foundational layer for the **Voting System**. Polls are created and broadcast within the context of a room.
*   The **Clip Generator** builds upon the conversations happening in rooms, allowing users to create content from their shared experiences.
*   The **Premium Tier System** acts as a gatekeeper for high-value features across all other components, such as creating rooms (Component 1) or generating a higher number of clips (Component 3).

This tight integration creates a powerful feedback loop: users join rooms, engage with the voting system, create and share clips, and are incentivized to upgrade to a premium tier to unlock more features.
